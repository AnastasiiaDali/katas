Given a list of integers, implement a BubbleSort function which sorts the integers in ascending order.

Bubble sort works by making multiple passes through the list. In each pass, it compares two adjacent values, then swaps them if they're in the wrong order. As a result, in each pass, the biggest number moves towards the end of the list. After all the passes, the list is sorted.
